I'm analyzing `mobility` data to examine economic mobility across generations in modern USA. This data, derived from extensive tax records, links adult income to parental income from previous decades. It presents aggregate statistics on economic mobility for hundreds of communities, covering most of the American population, along with covariate information. My focus is on predicting economic mobility based on community characteristics.
